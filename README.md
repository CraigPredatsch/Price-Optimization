# Price-Optimization
Project to determine optimal pricing for a product when given certain sales data

This project takes a set of sales data that includes sales for two different types of products in 2 different stores over a number of weeks. The data also says if there was a promotion or a holiday during each week, and what the price of each item was.

The script then analyzes the data and provides a demand curve for one of the products in a selected store and plots the demand.

Then, it outputs the profit when selling the item at various price points assuming the item has a variable cost $0.10, and a fixed cost of $0. The script lays a second plot over the first that has the profit at each price point when the fixed cost is $25.

Finally, the script draws a line showing the expected profit when pricing the product at the mean price point, and another line showing the expected profit when pricing the product at the optimal price point based on the calculated demand.

We can see that by taking the time to plot out demand and understand how many people are willing to pay at various price points, we can earn a great deal more in profit. In this example, the optimal price point delivered a profit of around $157, while the mean price only resulted in a profitability of about $53.
